This guide supposes we have linux server.
Create the machine and get console there, for example via ssh.

sudo yum pip install git
git clone https://github.com/vipnet1/Mirage.git

sudo yum pip install pip
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 .venv

mkdir .config
cd .config
mkdir environments
mkdir certificates

copy the certificates, used environments to the machine.
You can use scp/pscp.

Install mongodb & mongodb tools. Follow instructions on website to install via shell.

install requirements from the venv.

And you can run mirage.
Of course you need to do more stuff, like assign ip, domain, certificates, security rules and so on, but thats outside of this scope.
